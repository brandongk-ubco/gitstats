# Client Meeting 17 July 2020

## Agenda
- Discuss possibility of retrieving contributions / effort directly from source instead of self-reporting for COSC 499 Software Capstone.
- Discuss timelines and availability.

## Decisions
- Project timeline constrained to August due to availability.

## Questions
- Can we enforce a single service provider to limit the number of interfaces?
  - GitHub?
- Include both code contributions and non-code (team meetings, documentation, etc)?
- Can it be simple to setup and run, with no/little ongoing maintenance required?
